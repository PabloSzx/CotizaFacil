# GraphQLClient

This "_module_" is basically a "_fork_" of the library [**graphql-test**](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-request), but it adds extra cookie support for Node.js environments (using
[node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch), [fetch-cookie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fetch-cookie) and [tough-cookie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tough-cookie)) and an extra layer of abstraction for cleaner code.
