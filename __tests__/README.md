# Tests

We are using [**Jest**](https://jestjs.io/) as Testing Framework.

Any folder inside, except for helpers, should have their files ending in **.test.ts**

## api

---

This folder will contain all the tests regarding to the GraphQL API.

### auth.test.ts

This tests file contains assertions to verify the correct functionality of the **authentication** in the api.

## helpers

---

This folder is designed to contain common code needed for any of the test files.
